 Each card has its own value and suit. Users take turns: _raising/calling/folding_,
 while game stages consequently change in the following order: _preflop, flop, turn, river_. Before the move of next player, other players' moves are hidden, current best combination for this player is shown.

 Players with no money left are eliminated and new round begins.
 The game is played until there is only **one winner** left.
